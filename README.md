# go-radix benchmark

This repository created for testing [armon/go-radix](https://github.com/armon/go-radix) tree serialization in gob.

## consideration

* Encoding into gob is not allowed for a struct which does not have public fields.
	* Therefore, in this benchmark, I use gob via `map[string]interface{}` which is generated by `radix.Tree.ToMap()`.
* `radix.NewFromMap` iterate over `map[string]interface{}` and insert into node.
	* so, it's not reason to avoid insertion offline.
* That is to say insertion node or edge into tree cause overhead.
* For offline indexing: Is it effective that dump whole `radix.Tree` object?
